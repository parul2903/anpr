# **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) Using Google Cloud Vision API for OCR**

## **Overview**
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a technology that uses **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to extract vehicle registration numbers from images or video streams. This project utilizes the **Google Cloud Vision API** to recognize and process license plate numbers efficiently.

## **Setup and Usage**
### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parul2903/anpr
cd anpr
```

### **Create a Virtual Environment**
Create a conda or virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
conda create -n anpr_env python=3.7 -y
conda activate anpr_env
```
**OR**
```bash
conda create -p ./env python=3.7 -y
conda activate ./env/
```

### **Install Requirements**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Run the Server**
```bash
python rest-server.py
```

### **Testing the API (Using Postman)**
- Open **Postman** and send a **POST** request to the API endpoint.
- Upload an image containing a vehicle number plate.
- The API will return the extracted number plate text.

## **Google Cloud Vision API Setup**

1. **Enable Cloud Vision API**: Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Create a Service Account**: Generate a JSON key and store it securely.
3. **Set Environment Variable**: Point to the JSON key for authentication.

## **Applications of This Project**

1. **Traffic Law Enforcement**
   - Detects vehicles violating speed limits and traffic rules.
   - Helps identify stolen or unregistered vehicles.

2. **Automated Parking Management**
   - Enables contactless parking systems.
   - Automatically logs vehicle entries and exits.

3. **Toll Collection Systems**
   - Enhances electronic toll collection (ETC) systems.
   - Reduces the need for manual intervention at toll plazas.

4. **Smart City Surveillance**
   - Monitors road congestion and optimizes traffic flow.
   - Supports city-wide security and surveillance initiatives.

5. **Fleet Management**
   - Helps logistics companies track their fleet.
   - Ensures proper monitoring of vehicle movement and efficiency.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Improve OCR accuracy using deep learning models like **YOLO + OCR**.
- Integrate real-time ANPR with CCTV feeds.
- Add a database to store number plate records for future reference.
